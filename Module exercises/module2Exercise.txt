Practice exercise for Module 2

This practice exercise introduces the debugger, which is a tool of the IDE.
A "classic" debugging method is to print a variable value to screen to see if it's the expected value. However, in assembly programming it's not convenient to print data to screen, so we use the debugger to take a look at the "raw" data that's in memory and in registers.
The skills we learn in this exercise will be helpful for the rest of the quarter when we need to debug code.

1. In this step we bring a .asm file into the IDE project.
   - Open the IDE by clicking on the VC++ Project file in the Project32 folder.
   - Download module2exercise.asm from the class website.
   - At the Solution Explorer window of the IDE, right click on the existing .asm file 
     and select "Remove". 
     This removes the file from the project but doesn't delete the file.   
   - Add module2exercise.asm to the project by right click on the project name 
     and select "Add existing", and then choose the module2exercise.asm file.
     The module2exercise.asm file should appear in the Solution Explorer window.
   - Double click to open module2exercise.asm

2. Watch the short video "Using the debugger" that's on the class website, which shows how to use the debugger.

3. Use the debugger to fill in the values below.
   - Set a breakpoint at the mov ebx,-18 line and 
     run the program to the breakpoint.
   - Open the debugger Register window 
   - Run the instruction   mov ebx, -18   
   - Show what values are in the following registers:
	   
	BL:      EE  
	BH:    FF
	BX:    FFEE  ;FFEE is -18 :)
       EBX:FFFFFFEE

   - Open the debugger Memory window at the address of mesg.
     Copy the data of mesg as they appear in memory: 
48 65 6c 6c 6f 20 77 6f 72 6c 64 0d 0a
